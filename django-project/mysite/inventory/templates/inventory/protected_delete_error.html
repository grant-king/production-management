<p>To prevent accidental mass deletions, you can't delete a Product if it has any Purchase Orders and Customer 
    Orders associated with it. It is also not possible to delete a Customer 
    if it is associated with any Customer Orders.</p> 
<p>Delete associated Purchase Orders or Customer Orders first to avoid this error.</p>
